<details><summary>Grant via an Oracle</summary>
You can create a condition for a grant command to be issued by specifying an oracle app to check certain parameters, such as token ownership for example. Only if the oracle returns <code>true</code> then is the permission request approved.
Here's the syntax of how to implement this:
<pre>
grant &lt;entity&gt; &lt;app&gt; &lt;roleName&gt; [defaultPermissionManager] --oracle &lt;oracleAppName&gt;
</pre>

An excellent example of that is the [1hive token oracle](https://github.com/1Hive/token-oracle#readme) Aragon app, which is an [ACL oracle](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/aragonos-ref#parameter-interpretation) that returns true when the address that acts has a specific token. Take a look at this example:

```
grant ANY_ENTITY voting CREATE_VOTES_ROLE voting --oracle token-oracle.open
```
 
This action would grant any entity permission to create votes if they have a specific token. The token and minimum amount of tokens needed to hold would be specified when the app is installed to the DAO.
