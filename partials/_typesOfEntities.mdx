<summary>Types of Entities</summary>

An entity is an Ethereum Address. It can be specified using the Ethereum Address directly, using the entity identifier, or using an address that represents any entity.
- Specified Eth Address is expressed as the ETH address starting with `0x`. Only this address will be the specified entity.
- Identifier is the name of the internal Aragon App installed on your DAO, such as `voting`, `token-manager` (representing any token holder), or `agent`.
- Anyone is expressed as `ANY_ENTITY` and can be any user visiting your DAO with a web wallet.
