The Transactions app is a custom Aragon app built by [1Hive](https://1hive.org/). It allows users to create a single DAO vote to transfer or mint tokens to multiple addresses.

## Installing the App

You can install the Transactions app with the following syntax:

```
install transactions.open:new
```

### Common Usage Example

For the application frontend to appear in Aragon Client, you need to grant at least one role (hence, the DUMMY_ROLE):

```
load aragonos as ar

ar:connect exampleDAO token-manager voting (
  install transactions.open:new
  grant ANY_ENTITY transactions.open:new DUMMY_ROLE ANY_ENTITY
)
```

No unique functions or permissions can be called or granted for the Transactions app. Use the UI interface. 

:::info
Although the installation script says ANY_ENTITY, the app will only allow users with the right permissions/tokens according to the voting app you wish to create your vote through.

### Et Voil√†!
