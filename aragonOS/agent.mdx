The Agent App executes interactions with external Ethereum addresses, including smart contracts. Along with the Vault contract, the Agent can also hold its own Treasury, which a Finance App can manage. Multiple Agents can be helpful for various reasons, such as maintaining numerous treasuries or scoping permissions to external smart contracts related to your DAO or protocol (by making the Agent an owner or admin).

## Installing the App

There are no parameters needed to install a new agent to your DAO. However, the Agent relies on a tight set of permissions to do anything useful. Review the "Granting permissions" section before proceeding. You can use this syntax to install the Agent:

```
install agent:new
```

### Common Usage Example

When installing an Agent, we recommend grating the Voting app with the `TRANSFER_ROLE`, `EXECUTE_ROLE`, and `RUN_SCRIPT_ROLE` so `exec agent` and `act agent` commands can be used.

```
load aragonos as ar

ar:connect <organizationAddress> token-manager voting (
  install agent:new
  grant voting agent:new TRANSFER_ROLE voting
  grant voting agent:new EXECUTE_ROLE voting
  grant voting agent:new RUN_SCRIPT_ROLE voting
)
```

An Agent is a Vault on steroids, so after filling the Agent with some tokens, we can create a vote like this to transfer 1 ANT to my address:

```
load aragonos as ar

ar:connect <organizationAddress> token-manager voting (
  exec agent transfer @token(ANT) @me 1e18
)
```

## Granting Permissions

:::warning
This command can potentially burn a permission manager if it is set to the wrong address, making the permission unable to be changed in the future. This is because we usually want to set the main Voting app as the permission manager of all permissions.
:::

The Agent is made to carry out the requests from other apps or DAO members. So please, take some time to consider what entities need access to your Agent.

To grant permissions, you will use the following syntax:

```
grant <entity> <app> <roleName> [defaultPermissionManager]
```

In practice, this would look like this:

```
grant voting agent EXECUTE_ROLE voting
```

It would allow the Voting app to interact with external contracts or addresses using the Agent app.

Here is an exhaustive list of roles for the Agent app:

- `EXECUTE_ROLE`
  - Allows an entity to execute an external transaction through the Agent.
- `SAFE_EXECUTE_ROLE`
  - Allows the given entity to perform the `safeExecute` function through the Agent.
- `TRANSFER_ROLE`
  - Allows an entity to transfer tokens from the Agent's balance.
- `ADD_PROTECTED_TOKEN_ROLE`
  - Allows this entity to add tokens to a list of tokens that cannot be spent or transferred while the Agent executes an action using `safeExecute`.
- `REMOVE_PROTECTED_TOKEN_ROLE`
  - Allows this entity to remove tokens from a list of tokens that cannot be spent or transferred while the Agent executes an action using `safeExecute`.
- `ADD_PRESIGNED_HASH_ROLE`
  - Allows this entity to add a presigned hash to the Agent. [Learn more](https://forum.aragon.org/t/agent-app-arbitrary-actions-from-daos/275).
- `DESIGNATE_SIGNER_ROLE`
  - Designates this entity as a signer for the Agent. [Learn more](https://forum.aragon.org/t/agent-app-arbitrary-actions-from-daos/275).
- `RUN_SCRIPT_ROLE`
  - Allows this entity to run an EVM script on the Agent.

## Revoking Permissions

To remove permission from an entity, follow this syntax:

```
revoke <entity> <app> <roleName> [removePermissionManager=false]
```

In practice, this could look like this:

```
revoke voting agent TRANSFER_ROLE
```

It would remove the ability for the Voting app to transfer funds held by the Agent while keeping the Permission Manager in place should this permission need to be modified in the future.

## Internal Actions

Using the `exec` command, we can create internal actions.

We'll use the `transfer` function to show the syntax of the `exec` command. The base syntax looks like this:

```
exec agent[:<id>] transfer <token> <to> <amount>
```

For example:

```
load aragonos as ar

ar:connect exampleDAO token-manager voting (
  exec agent transfer @token(ANT) agent:1 100e18
)
```

It would create a vote to transfer 100 ANT tokens from the first Agent to the second Agent, given a second Agent is installed.

Below is an exhaustive list of all possible internal actions you can perform with the Agent app. In addition, we will identify the function in the contract and outline any parameters and permissions you need and the expected syntax to run them.

<details>
<summary>safeExecute</summary>
Executes the specified action to an external contract while preventing protected tokens from being spent.

#### Parameters
- `target` - The address of the external contract you want to interact with. (address)
- `data` - Calldata for the action. (bytes)

#### Permissions

The entity executing the action via the Agent will need the `SAFE_EXECUTE_ROLE` role.

#### Syntax

```
exec agent safeExecute <target> <data>
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>addProtectedToken</summary>

It will add a specified token address to a list of tokens that cannot be spent or transferred while executed by the Agent using `safeExecute`.

#### Parameters
- `token` - The token address of the token you want to protect.

#### Permissions

The entity executing the action via the Agent will need the `ADD_PROTECTED_TOKEN_ROLE` role. (address)

#### Syntax

```
exec agent addProtectedtoken <token>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>removeProtectedToken</summary>

It will remove a specified token address from a list of tokens that cannot be spent or transferred while executed by the Agent using `safeExecute`.

#### Parameters
- `token` - The token address of the token you want to remove from the protected tokens list. (address)

#### Permissions

The entity executing the action via the Agent will need the `REMOVE_PROTECTED_TOKEN_ROLE` role.

#### Syntax

```
exec agent removeProtectedtoken <token>
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>presignHash</summary>

Identifies a hash that will automatically be considered signed.

#### Parameters

- `hash` - The hash that will be considered signed automatically. (bytes)

#### Permissions
The entity executing the action via the Agent will need the `ADD_PRESIGNED_HASH_ROLE` role.

#### Syntax

```
exec agent presignHash <hash>
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>setDesignatedSigner</summary>

Sets an address as the designated signer of the app, which then can sign messages on behalf of the app.

#### Parameters

- `address` - The address of the entity you want to designate as the signer. (address)

#### Permissions

The entity executing the action via the Agent will need the `DESIGNATE_SIGNER_ROLE` role.

#### Syntax

```
exec agent setDesignatedSigner <address>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>transfer</summary>

Transfers tokens from the Agent to a specified address.

#### Parameters

- `token` - The token contract address of the token you wish to transfer. (address)
- `to` - The address to send tokens to. (address)
- `value` - The number of tokens you wish to send, considering the decimal precision. (uint256)

#### Permissions

The entity executing the action via the Agent will need the `TRANSFER_ROLE` role.

#### Syntax

```
exec agent transfer <token> <to> <value>
```

</details>


## External Actions
The Agent uses the `act` command to interact with external entities such as smart contracts. The entity wishing to execute an external action will need the role `RUN_SCRIPT_ROLE`.
 The syntax is as follows:

```
act <agent> <targetAddress> <function> [inputParameters]
```

The functions for a given *verified* smart contract can be found on the `write` or `write proxy` page in the network's block explorer. For example, here is the [contract for the DAI Stablecoin](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f#writeContract). We can use the basic task of sending DAI to another address to showcase the syntax for `act`:

```
load aragonos as ar

ar:connect exampleDAO token-manager voting (
  act agent @token(DAI) transfer(address,uint256) @me 100e18
)
```

As you can see, we use the helpers @token and @me to retrieve the required addresses.


A complete example could be to approve and deposit 1,000 DAI from the Agent to the Aave Lending Pool V2: ([`0x7d2768de32b0b80b7a3454c06bdac94a69ddc7a9`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7d2768de32b0b80b7a3454c06bdac94a69ddc7a9#writeProxyContract)).

```
load aragonos as ar
set $aaveLendingPool 0x7d2768de32b0b80b7a3454c06bdac94a69ddc7a9

ar:connect exampleDAO token-manager voting (
  act agent @token(DAI) approve(address,unint256) $aaveLendingPool 1000e18
  act agent $aaveLendingPool deposit(address,uint256,address,uint16) @token(DAI) 1000e18 agent 0
)
```
