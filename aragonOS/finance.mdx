The Finance App will allow you to keep track of your DAO's finances, each app can only interact with funds held in one Ethereum Address. Having multiple Finance Apps will allow you to manage multiple treasuries.


## Installing the App


The syntax is as follows to install the app:

```
install finance:new <vaultAddress> <periodDuration>
```

To Install the Voting App you'll need to include two parameters:
 - `vault`
    - This is the address of the installed Vault or Agent where the finance app will manage funds.
 - `periodDuration`
    - This is the budgeting period duration. This parameter is required but only relevant if you plan to make use of the budgeting feature (currently not on the UI).


### Common Usage Example

You can install a vault (or an agent) alongside with the finance app, and set up these permissions.
```
connect exampleDAO token-manager voting (
install vault:new
install finance:new vault:new 30d
grant finance:new vault:new TRANSFER_ROLE voting
grant voting finance:new CREATE_PAYMENTS_ROLE voting
)
```

import InstallVersioning from '../partials/_installVersioning.mdx'

<InstallVersioning />

## Granting Permissions

:::warning
This command can potentially burn a permission manager if it is set to the wrong address, making the permission unable to be changed in the future. We usually want to set the main voting app as the permission manager of all permissions.
:::

To grant permissions you'll use the following syntax:

```
grant <entity> <app> <roleName> [defaultPermissionManager]
```

In practice this would look like:

```
grant voting finance CREATE_PAYMENTS_ROLE voting
````

Which would give the voting app permission to create payments on the finance app.

Before installing an app you should consider any permissions it will need to fit your purposes. Here is an exhaustive list of roles for the voting app:

- `CREATE_PAYMENTS_ROLE`
    - Allows an entity to create a payment request
- `CHANGE_PERIOD_ROLE`
    - Allows an entity the budget period
- `CHANGE_BUDGETS_ROLE`
    - Allows an entity to modify the budget for the set period
- `EXECUTE_PAYMENTS_ROLE`
    - Allows an entity to execute payments
- `MANAGE_PAYMENTS_ROLE`
    - Allows an entity to manage payments

import OracleGrant from '../partials/_oracleGrant.mdx';

<OracleGrant />

Some functionalities have been added to the contract that have not yet been added to the UI, including creating budgets and setting budget periods. You can create and manage these on the DAO but will have no practical way to interact with them on the UI, you can learn more in the [Aragon developer documentation](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/guides-custom-deploy#adding-a-vault-and-finance-instance).

## Revoking Permissions

To remove a permission from an entity follow this syntax:

```
revoke <entity> <app> <roleName> [removePermissionManager=false]
```

in practice this could look like:

```
revoke voting finance EXECUTE_PAYMENTS_ROLE
```

This would remove the ability for the voting app to execute a payment, while keeping the Permission Manager in place should this permission need to be modified in the future.

## Internal Actions

Using the `exec` command we can create internal actions.

We'll use the `newImmediatePayment` function to show the syntax of the `exec` command. This is the base syntax:

```
exec finance[:<id>] newImmediatePayment <token> <to> <amount> <description>
```

For example:

```
connect exampleDAO token-manager voting (
exec finance newImmediatePayment @token(ANT) 0x62Bb362d63f14449398B79EBC46574F859A6045D 100e18 "payment for documentation work"
)
```

This would request to send 100 ANT tokens to 0x62Bb362d63f14449398B79EBC46574F859A6045D with the context of "payment for documentation work", which would show up on a DAO vote.
