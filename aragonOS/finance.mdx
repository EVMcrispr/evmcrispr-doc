The Finance App will allow you to keep track of your DAO's finances, and each app can only interact with funds held in one Ethereum Address. Having multiple Finance Apps will allow you to manage various treasuries.


## Installing the App


The syntax is as follows to install the app:

```
install finance:new <vaultAddress> <periodDuration>
```

To Install the Voting App you'll need to include two parameters:
 - `vault`
    - This is the address of the installed Vault or Agent where the Finance app will manage funds.
 - `periodDuration`
    - This is the budgeting period duration. This parameter is required but only relevant if you plan to use the budgeting feature (currently not on the UI).


### Common Usage Example

You can install a Vault (or an Agent) alongside the Finance app and set up these permissions.
```
load aragonos as ar

ar:connect exampleDAO token-manager voting (
  install vault:new
  install finance:new vault:new 30d
  grant finance:new vault:new TRANSFER_ROLE voting
  grant voting finance:new CREATE_PAYMENTS_ROLE voting
)
```

import InstallVersioning from '../partials/_installVersioning.mdx'

<InstallVersioning />

## Granting Permissions

:::warning
This command can potentially burn a permission manager if it is set to the wrong address, making the permission unable to be changed in the future. This is because we usually want to set the main Voting app as the permission manager of all permissions.
:::

To grant permissions, you'll use the following syntax:

```
grant <entity> <app> <roleName> [defaultPermissionManager]
```

In practice, this would look like this:

```
grant voting finance CREATE_PAYMENTS_ROLE voting
```

It would allow the Voting app to create payments on the Finance app.

Before installing an app, you should consider any permissions needed to fit your purposes. Here is an exhaustive list of roles for the Voting app:

- `CREATE_PAYMENTS_ROLE`
    - Allows an entity to create a payment request
- `CHANGE_PERIOD_ROLE`
    - Allows an entity the budget period
- `CHANGE_BUDGETS_ROLE`
    - Allows an entity to modify the budget for the set period
- `EXECUTE_PAYMENTS_ROLE`
    - Allows an entity to execute payments
- `MANAGE_PAYMENTS_ROLE`
    - Allows an entity to manage payments

import OracleGrant from '../partials/_oracleGrant.mdx';

Some functionalities that have not yet been added to the UI are already present in the contract, including creating budgets and setting budget periods. You can create and manage these on the DAO but will have no practical way to interact with them on the UI, and you can learn more in the [Aragon developer documentation](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/guides-custom-deploy#adding-a-vault-and-finance-instance).

## Revoking Permissions

To remove permission from an entity, follow this syntax:

```
revoke <entity> <app> <roleName> [removePermissionManager=false]
```

In practice, this could look like this:

```
revoke voting finance EXECUTE_PAYMENTS_ROLE
```

It would remove the ability for the Voting app to execute a payment while keeping the Permission Manager in place should this permission need to be modified in the future.

## Internal Actions

Using the `exec` command, we can create internal actions.

We'll use the `newImmediatePayment` function to show the syntax of the `exec` command. The base syntax looks like this:

```
exec finance[:<id>] newImmediatePayment <token> <to> <amount> <description>
```

For example:

```
load aragonos as ar

ar:connect exampleDAO token-manager voting (
  exec finance newImmediatePayment @token(ANT) 0x62Bb362d63f14449398B79EBC46574F859A6045D 100e18 "payment for documentation work"
)
```

It would request to send 100 ANT tokens to 0x62Bb362d63f14449398B79EBC46574F859A6045D with the context of "payment for documentation work", which would show up on a DAO vote.
