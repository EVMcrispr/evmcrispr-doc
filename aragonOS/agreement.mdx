The agreement app is used to define and manage an agreement or set of rules that participants of your DAO should adhere to. This contract also manages settling or escalating potential infractions of the aforementioned DAO agreement. It has no UI and is usually interacted with by an instance of [Gardens](https://gardens.1hive.org/#/home) which is developed by [1Hive](https://1hive.org/). 

## Installing the App

To install the agreement app, you'll need to figure out a few parameters:

- `arbitrator`
    - This is the Ethereum address decentralized court where escalated disputes are sent to be arbitrated.
- `setAppFeesCashier`
    - Whether to integrate with the Arbitrator's fee cashier (true or false)
- `title`
    - The title of your agreement document (string)
- `content` 
    - An IPFS link to your agreement document that has been converted to hex format and prepended with `0x`. You can use [**this tool**](https://dencode.com/string/hex) to convert the text for the IPFS link to hex format.

When you have the parameters for the agreement app you can install it with the following syntax:

```
install agreement.open:new <arbitratorAddress> <setAppFeesCashier?> <titleString> <IPFSlinkToContentInHex>
// add any permissions you want to grant here.
```

In practice this could look like:

```
connect exampleDAO disputable-voting.open
install agreement.open:new 0x44e4fcfed14e1285c9e0f6eae77d5fdd0f196f85 false "NASCAR DAO Community Covenant" 0x516d6657707071433535586337505534387665693258765641754837367a32724e4646374a4d55686a564d357856
grant disputable-voting.open:0 agreement.open:new CHANGE_AGREEMENT_ROLE disputable-voting.open:0
grant disputable-voting.open:0 agreement.open:new MANAGE_DISPUTABLE_ROLE disputable-voting.open:0
```
This would install a new agreement app and grant all the necessary permissions to manage the settings to the installed disputable-voting app

## Granting Permissions

:::warning
This command can potentially remove a permission manager if it is set to the wrong address, making the permission unable to be changed in the future. We usually want to set the main voting app as the permission manager of all permissions.

The most critical permissions are argumentably the ones on the Kernel (DAO main contract) and the ACL (permission management contract), so be careful who we grant them to.
:::

To grant permissions you'll use the following syntax:

```
grant <entity> <app> <roleName> [defaultPermissionManager]
```

In practice this would look like:

```
grant disputable-voting.open agreement.open MANAGE_DISPUTABLE_ROLE disputable-voting.open
```
Which would grant the installed disputable-voting app the permission to change the dispute settings of any eligible app inside the DAO. This permission itself would also be managed by the disputable-voting app.

Before installing the agreement app you should understand a few important pieces of the pie, including app roles defined within the contract, they are:

- `CHALLENGE_ROLE`
    - Allows the specified entity to challenge a proposal
- `CHANGE_AGREEMENT_ROLE`
    - Allows the specified entity to change the DAO's agreement
- `MANAGE_DISPUTABLE_ROLE`
    - Allows the specified entity to change the related settings of a conviction-voting or disputable-voting app, such as Challenge Duration, Action Amount, Challenge Amount and the token used as collateral for a dispute in the respective app.

## Revoking Permissions

To remove a permission from an entity follow this syntax:

```
revoke <entity> <app> <roleName> [removePermissionManager=false]
```

in practice this could look like:

```
revoke disputable-voting.open:0 MANAGE_DISPUTABLE_ROLE false
```
Which would remove the ability of the 1st disputable voting app to manage the proposal collateral settings of the DAO.

## Internal Actions

Using the `exec` command we can create internal actions. This can change the settings of the app itself of create actions to interact with other apps installed in the DAO.

We'll use the [`activate` function](https://github.com/1Hive/agreement-app/blob/17181dc84cd0351c92831e1bc07c3a2251a6cabe/contracts/Agreement.sol#L232) to showcase the syntax for this command.

```
exec agreement.open activate <disputableAddress> <collateralToken> <challengeDuration> <actionAmount> <challengeAmount>
```

In practice this function could look like:

```
connect exampleDAO disputable-voting.open:0
exec agreement.open activate disputable-voting.open:1 @token(HNY) 3d 10e18 10e18
```

This would activate the already installed disputable-voting app, making the collateral token Honey(HNY) with a challenge duration of 3 days, the action amount 10 HNY and the challenge amount 10 HNY as well. To make our script easier to write we take advantage of a few features of EVMcrispr that you can learn more about in the [Syntatic Sugar section](/getStarted/syntaxSugar).

Below is an exhaustive list of all possible actions you can perform with the agreement app. we'll identify the function in the contract and outline any parameters and permissions you need and the expected syntax to run them.
