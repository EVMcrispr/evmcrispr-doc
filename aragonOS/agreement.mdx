The agreement app defines and manages an agreement or set of rules that participants of your DAO should adhere to. This contract also manages settling or escalating potential infractions of the aforementioned DAO agreement. It has no UI and is usually interacted with by an instance of [Gardens](https://gardens.1hive.org/#/home), which is developed by [1Hive](https://1hive.org/). 

## Installing the App

The syntax is as follows to install this app:

```
install agreement.open:new <arbitratorAddress> <setAppFeesCashier> <titleString> ipfs:<agreementIpfsLink>
```

To install the Agreement app, you'll need to figure out a few parameters:

- `arbitrator`
    - This is the Ethereum address decentralized court where escalated disputes are sent to be arbitrated.
- `setAppFeesCashier`
    - Whether to integrate with the arbitrator's fee cashier (true or false).
- `title`
    - The title of your agreement document.
- `content` 
    - An IPFS link to your agreement document in the format `ipfs:Qm...`. You can provide it as a string, and EVMcrispr will convert it automatically to bytes required by the contract.


### Common Usage Example

The following script would install a new Agreement app and grant all the necessary permissions to manage the settings to the installed Disputable Voting app:

```
load aragonos as ar

ar:connect exampleDAO disputable-voting.open ()
  install agreement.open:new 0x44e4fcfed14e1285c9e0f6eae77d5fdd0f196f85 false "NASCAR DAO Community Covenant" 0x516d6657707071433535586337505534387665693258765641754837367a32724e4646374a4d55686a564d357856
  grant disputable-voting.open:0 agreement.open:new CHANGE_AGREEMENT_ROLE disputable-voting.open:0
  grant disputable-voting.open:0 agreement.open:new MANAGE_DISPUTABLE_ROLE disputable-voting.open:0
)
```

## Granting Permissions

To grant permissions, you'll use the following syntax:

```
grant <entity> <app> <roleName> [defaultPermissionManager]
```

In practice, this would look like this:

```
grant disputable-voting.open agreement.open MANAGE_DISPUTABLE_ROLE disputable-voting.open
```
It would grant the installed Disputable Voting app permission to change the dispute settings of any eligible app inside the DAO. The Disputable Voting app would also manage this permission itself.

Before installing the Agreement app you should understand a few important pieces of the pie, including app roles defined within the contract. They are:

- `CHALLENGE_ROLE`
    - Allows the specified entity to challenge a proposal.
- `CHANGE_AGREEMENT_ROLE`
    - Allows the specified entity to change the DAO's agreement.
- `MANAGE_DISPUTABLE_ROLE`
    - Allows the specified entity to change the related settings of any disputable app, such as Challenge Duration, Action Amount, Challenge Amount, and the token used as collateral for a dispute in the respective app.

<TypesOfEntities />


## Revoking Permissions

To remove permission from an entity, follow this syntax:

```
revoke <entity> <app> <roleName> [removePermissionManager=false]
```

In practice, this could look like this:

```
revoke disputable-voting.open:0 agreement.open MANAGE_DISPUTABLE_ROLE
```

It would remove the ability of the first Disputable Voting app to manage the proposal collateral settings of the DAO.

## Internal Actions

Using the `exec` command, we can create internal actions that will modify the settings of our Voting app.

To showcase the `exec` command, we'll use the `activate` function. We use the following base syntax:

```
exec <app> <methodName> [parameters]
```

For example:

```
exec agreement.open activate <disputableAddress> <collateralToken> <challengeDuration> <actionAmount> <challengeAmount>
```

In practice, this function could look like this:

```
load aragonos as ar

ar:connect exampleDAO disputable-voting.open:0 (
  exec agreement.open activate disputable-voting.open:1 @token(HNY) 3d 10e18 10e18
)
```

It would activate the already installed Disputable Voting app, making Honey (HNY) the collateral token, with a challenge duration of 3 days, an action amount of 10 HNY, and a challenge amount of 10 HNY. To make our script easier to write, we take advantage of a few features of EVMcrispr that you can learn more about in the [Syntactic Sugar section](/getStarted/syntaxSugar).

Below is an exhaustive list of all possible actions you can perform with the Agreement app. We'll identify the function in the contract and outline any parameters and permissions you need and the expected syntax to run them.
