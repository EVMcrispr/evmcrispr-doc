Disputable Voting (also referred to as Tao Voting or Decision Voting) is an app developed initially by Aragon One and maintained by [1Hive](https://1hive.org/). It has no UI and should be accessed by a deployed instance of [Gardens](https://gardens.1hive.org/#/home). Gardens is a tool for DAOs that utilizes AragonOS with a custom UI on top. Learn more about Disputable Voting in the [Gardens Documentation](https://1hive.gitbook.io/gardens/on-chain-governance/garden-framework/decision-voting).

## Installing the App


To install the app follow this syntax:

```
install disputable-voting.open:new <tokenAddress> <voteTime> <supportRequiredPct> <minAcceptQuorumPct> <delegatedVotingPeriod> <quietEndingPeriod> <quietEndingExtension> <executionDelay>
```

You'll need the following parameters to install a new Disputable Voting app to your DAO:

- `token`
    - This is the associated token address used to vote in Disputable Voting.
- `voteTime`
    - The period votes should be open and eligible to be voted on. This is expressed in seconds but can use EVMcrispr's syntactic sugar for [expressing time](/getStarted/syntaxSugar#time) in other units.
- `supportRequiredPct`
    - The percentage of YES votes vs. NO votes needed to pass a proposal. This parameter is expressed in WAD. i.e., for a Support Required of 51%, this is 0.51, which in WAD equals *51e16* (51000000000000000000).
- `minAcceptQuorumPct`
    - This is the YES votes needed from the total token supply. This parameter is expressed in WAD, similar to the example above in support required.
- `delegatedVotingPeriod`
    - The time votes are eligible to be voted on by delegates. It is expressed in seconds but can use EVMcrispr's syntactic sugar for [expressing time](/getStarted/syntaxSugar#time) in other units.
- `quietEndingPeriod`
    - The amount of time where Disputable Voting will watch for a change of outcome. It is expressed in seconds but can use EVMcrispr's syntactic sugar for [expressing time](/getStarted/syntaxSugar#time) in other units.
- `quietEndingExtension`
    - The time where Disputable Voting will extend the vote duration in case of a change of outcome during the quietEndingPeriod. This parameter is expressed in seconds but can use EVMcrispr's syntactic sugar for [expressing time](/getStarted/syntaxSugar#time) in other units.
- `executionDelay`
    - The amount of time from when a vote ends until the proposed execution will be executed. It is expressed in seconds but can use EVMcrispr's syntactic sugar for [expressing time](/getStarted/syntaxSugar#time) in other units.

### Common Usage Example

After installing a new Disputable Voting app, one of the most important permissions to set up is the `CREATE_VOTES_ROLE`. Without it, the app is useless.

```
load aragonos as ar

ar:connect exampleDAO disputable-voting.open:0 (
  install disputable-voting.open:new @token(HNY) 7d 85e16 10e16 3d 2d 2d 12h
  grant disputable-voting.open:new disputable-voting.open:new CREATE_VOTES_ROLE disputable-voting.open:0
  grant disputable-voting.open:new disputable-voting.open:new CHANGE_VOTE_TIME_ROLE disputable-voting.open:0
  grant disputable-voting.open:new disputable-voting.open:new CHANGE_SUPPORT_ROLE disputable-voting.open:0
  grant disputable-voting.open:new disputable-voting.open:new CHANGE_QUORUM_ROLE disputable-voting.open:0
  grant disputable-voting.open:new disputable-voting.open:new CHANGE_DELEGATED_VOTING_PERIOD_ROLE disputable-voting.open:0
  grant disputable-voting.open:new disputable-voting.open:new CHANGE_QUIET_ENDING_ROLE disputable-voting.open:0
  grant disputable-voting.open:new disputable-voting.open:new CHANGE_EXECUTION_DELAY_ROLE disputable-voting.open:0
  exec agreement.open activate disputable-voting.open:new @token(HNY) 10e18 10e18 3d
)
```

This script will install a new Disputable Voting app and grant it all the necessary permissions to manage its settings while allowing the first Diisputable Voting app to manage its permissions. It also activates the Disputable Voting app with the installed Agreement app, connecting it with the agreement content and settings.

In this example, the Disputable Voting app would have a vote duration of 7 days, require 85% support, 10% quorum with a delegated voting period of 3 days, a quiet ending of 2 days, a quiet ending extension of 2 additional days, and an execution delay of 12 hours.

The agreement settings for this app would set the collateral token as HNY, requiring 10 HNY to be deposited for each action, 10 HNY to challenge, and a challenge duration of 3 days.

We take advantage of EVMcrispr's syntactic sugar to make writing this script easier, [learn more in this article](/getStarted/syntaxSugar).


## Granting Permissions

:::warning
This command can potentially remove a permission manager if it is set to the wrong address, making the permission unable to be changed in the future. This is because we usually want to set the main Disputable Voting app as the permission manager of all permissions.

The most critical permissions are on the Kernel (DAO main contract) and the ACL (permission management contract), so be careful to who we grant them to.
:::

To grant permissions, you'll use the following syntax:

`grant <entity> <app> <roleName> [defaultPermissionManager]`

In practice, this would look like this:

`grant token-manager disputable-voting.open CREATE_VOTES_ROLE disputable-voting.open`

This command would allow token holders of the associated token manager to create votes on the Disputable Voting app.

Before installing an app, you should consider any permissions it will need to fit your purposes. Here is an exhaustive list of roles for the Disputable Voting app:

 - `CREATE_VOTES_ROLE`
    - Allows a given entity to create votes in the Disputable Voting app.
 - `CHANGE_VOTE_TIME_ROLE`
    - Allows a given entity to change the voting time in the Disputable Voting app.
 - `CHANGE_SUPPORT_ROLE`
    - Allows a given entity to change the support required in the Disputable Voting app.
 - `CHANGE_QUORUM_ROLE`
    - Allows a given entity to change the minimum approval in the Disputable Voting app.
 - `CHANGE_DELEGATED_VOTING_PERIOD_ROLE`
    - Allows a given entity to change the delegated voting period in the Disputable Voting app.
 - `CHANGE_EXECUTION_DELAY_ROLE`
    - Allows a given entity to change the execution delay in the Disputable Voting app.
 - `CHANGE_QUIET_ENDING_ROLE`
    - Allows a given entity to change the quiet ending period in the Disputable Voting app.

## Revoking Permissions

To remove permission from an entity, follow this syntax:

```
revoke <entity> <app> <roleName> [removePermissionManager=false]
```

In practice, this could look like this:

```
revoke disputable-voting.open:0 disputable-voting.open:1 CHANGE_VOTE_TIME_ROLE false
```

It would remove the ability of the first Disputable Voting app to change the voting time of the second Disputable Voting app.

## Internal Actions

Using the `exec` command, we can create internal actions that will modify the settings of our Disputable Voting app.

We will modify the quiet ending configuration to showcase the `exec` command. We use the following base syntax:


```
exec <app> <methodName> [parameters]
```

For example:

```
load aragonos as ar

ar:connect exampleDAO disputable-voting --context "Change quiet ending config" (
  exec disputable-voting.open changeQuietEndingConfiguration 1d 3d
)
```

It would create a vote to change the quiet ending period and quiet ending extension to one and three days, respectively.
