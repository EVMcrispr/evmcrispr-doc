# Script Cookbook

In EVMcrispr the possibilities are nearly endless for the complex scripts you can write and execute. This cookbook will hopefully give you some "recipes" for interesting interaction you can perform using this tool. We'll make use of the myriad of helpers, commands and modules to show off the power of EVMcrispr! Recipes will be categorized by some common themes in Blockchain.
