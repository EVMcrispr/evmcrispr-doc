# Script Cookbook

In EVMcrispr, the possibilities are nearly endless for the complex scripts you can write and execute. This cookbook will hopefully give you some "recipes" for interesting interactions you can perform using this tool. We'll use the myriad helpers, commands, and modules to show off the power of EVMcrispr! Some common themes in Blockchain will categorize recipes.
