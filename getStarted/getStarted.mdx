[**EVMcrispr**](https://evm-crispr.blossom.software/) is a powerful tool that combines a command line interface with a Javascript library to create multi-action EVM scripts, including interacting with Aragon DAOs. With it, you can bundle many operations into just one script, generating a singular transaction.

In it's current state, EVMcrispr is geared towards management of DAO's using the AaragonOS framework, including [Garden DAOs](https://gardens.1hive.org/#/home). It currently supports AragonOS v4 and v5, allowing for a wealth of possible DAO actions, including:

- Installing new native and custom aragon apps.
- Granting or Revoking permissions.
- Modifying the settings of apps.
- Creating internal actions with installed apps or interacting with external contracts on the blockchain.

The true beauty of EVMcrispr is that you don't need to be a pro developer in order to create complex and powerful EVMscripts for DAOs. There are in fact only two requirements to start using this tool:

1. A modern web browser installed. (We recommend Brave)
2. A crypto web wallet extension installed on said modern browser. (like MetaMask)

That being said in order to fully grasp the utilities of EVMcrispr you should have some intermediate knowledge of Ethereum, Javascript and navigating Block Explorers such as [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io) for example.


## Using EVMcrispr

The most typical applications of EVMcrispr will be to create mutli-action scripts that can be sent to DAOs to be voted on. As mentioned, EVMcrispr in it's current form is tailor made to work within the AragonOS framework, navigating it's library of native and custom apps and system of permissions.

The EVMcrispr terminal is where you will make your scripts. This is where the magic happpens. Simply connect with your web wallet and switch to the same EVM compatible chain of the DAO that you want to interact with (i.e Mainnet, Matic, Gnosis Chain etc..).

### Sending Scripts

 When writing a script each line on the terminal is used to define another action that will be bundled into the same script.

Once you're ready to send your script hit `Forward` and EVMcrispr will generate the transaction for you to sign with your web wallet.

If you want to send a script of multiple actions to a specific contract, or multiple contracts on the connected network you can do so using the `exec` command. Follow this syntax:

```bash
exec <contractAddress> <functionName>([argumentTypes]) [parameters...]
```

For example:

```bash
set $token.tokenlist https://tokens.honeyswap.org/
exec 0xD93d3bDBa18ebcB3317a57119ea44ed2Cf41C2F2 getReward()
exec 0x24F2d06446AF8D6E89fEbC205e7936a602a87b60 approve(address,uint256) @me @token.balance(GIV,@me)
exec 0x24F2d06446AF8D6E89fEbC205e7936a602a87b60 wrap(uint256) @token.balance(GIV,@me)
```

Or If you're sending scripts to an AragonOS compatible DAO you'll need to preface your scripts with the `connect` command. More on that in the [AragonOS section](/aragonOS/#the-connect-command)

### Sending Multiple Scripts

If you want to send multiple scripts at once all you need to do is separate them with a blank row. Each separated script will produce a separate transaction that needs to be signed with your web wallet. Here's a basic idea of how this would look:

```bash
# script 1
connect <myDAO> [forwardPath] (
[some action we want the script to do]
)

# script 2
connect <myOtherDAO> [forwardPath] (
[some action we want the 2nd script to do]
)
```


## Who uses EVMcrispr?

Some notable DAOs have already found great success using EVMcrispr, check out some of the use cases these formidable DAOs have found:

- [**CurveDAO**](https://curve.fi/) used it to [upgrade it’s voting app](https://gov.curve.fi/t/allowing-for-fractional-votes-by-curve-dao/2456) implementation contract.
- [**1Hive**](https://1hive.org/) used it to claim it’s ENS airdrop and transfer the funds of it’s mainnet DAO.
- [**Giveth**](https://giveth.io/) used it to replace the Unipool contract for another one in their gardens DAO and currently uses it to [distribute GIVbacks](https://giveth.io/givbacks).
- [**TECommons**](https://tecommons.org/) used it for [minting and burning tokens](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/one-time-change-of-tech-addresses-as-requested-by-owner-because-access-was-lost-or-another-reason/571) and also for migrating to a [gardens DAO and installing a bonding curve](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/commons-upgrade-demo-part-2/723).
- [**BrightId**](https://brightid.org/) is using it to change the [parameters on their garden’s conviction voting app](https://forum.brightid.org/t/revisiting-the-brightdao-parameters-with-general-magic-support/355), and will use it to install the [BrightId Gatekeeper](https://forum.brightid.org/t/brightid-gatekeeper-for-aragon-permissions/131) as an ACL oracle.
- [**Agave**](https://agave.finance/) used it to remove the vesting of some of their seeds and transfer funds from their agent to many contributors.
